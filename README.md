## Disclaimer
This is a bit odd - I get it. </br></br>

This is a living document and is still a work in progress. It’s meant to be documentation on me. It’s not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together.

---
## Why does this exist?

`#1` Developing this has helped me hone in on and refine my thought process and values. 

`#2` Ideally, this will aid you in better understanding my philosophies and help us work together.

## My Job

**I work for you**.

`important` : If you feel like I’m not meeting any of those responsibilities or expectations - you’d do me a huge favor by letting me know asap. 

>Note: I promise I'll add more stuff here just as soon as I figure out what I'm doing here. 


---
## My Availability:
- `rule #1:` Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk. I'm never too busy for you

- My calendars full? Don't wait until next week to find an opening. if it's important, let me know and I'll make it work. Reminder - see rule # 1. 

- Sometimes I work weekends. That doesn’t mean you’re expected to, unless there’s something urgent.

## My Assumptions about you / the team

`You’re very good at your job` You wouldn’t be here if you weren't.

`I’m not as good at your job as you.` You know best. I’ll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you vet your ideas but I won’t override you. 

`You’ll let me know if you can’t do your job.` One of my main responsibilities is making sure you have the tools to be successful. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won’t know if I’m letting you down. 

`You feel safe debating me.` I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles. If I sound like I’m disagreeing, I’m more than likely playing devils advocate. I’ll get scared if we always agree on everything.

## My North Stars
- **People > Processes.** Agile or scrum not working? Great, let’s find a solution that is effective. 
- [Servant leadership](https://medium.com/openclassrooms-product-design-and-engineering/manage-a-tech-team-as-a-servant-leader-d04e055577b3)
- **Critical thinking** - _nothing_ is sacred. No cargo culting e.g. “we’ve always done it that way”.
- I believe in the **compounding awesomeness** of _continually_ fixing small things. 
- I am **biased towards action**. Endless debates < progress. (_This doesn’t substitute the need for planning before action_)
- **Work life balance** is not another "woke" saying I'll use solely because it's trendy right now and my manager book tells me to embrace it. I **cherish** life outside of work, my family and friends, my passions, my health. You should too, and I'll police you to make sure you're maintaining a healthy balance.

## 1:1s
- These meetings are primarily for you, and only secondary for me. 
- Not a status meeting (unless you want to chat status). This time is meant for:
Building trust around mutual goals
- Understanding how your work is going (**not** what are you working on?)
- Providing honest feedback (both ways ←→ )
- Can be a zoom call, phone call while we go on a walk, walkie talkies. You tell me. 
- This is your time, so please come prepared. 


---
## The Team
**If I describe my ideal for our team and each person on it, it is that we:**
- Take control of and responsibility for our own destiny
- We have each others back
- Expect excellence in ourselves and one another
- Assume positive intent
- Always question, ask “why?”
- Constantly learn
- Laugh together, alot.
- Position ourselves and our career to be in a better spot tomorrow than it is today. 


## License
>I ~~stole~~ reused this concept from some Engineering manager at Netflix so whatever license he used is what I'm using.
